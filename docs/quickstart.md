# QuickStart

### 0. Setup your development environment

You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

Install [Node.jsÂ® and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if they are not already on your machine.

xpx-typescript-angular-sdk is build with Typescript and Angular 6.x, please ensure that you have the latest version installed.

```bash
npm install -g typescript @angular/cli
```

### 1. Create a new project

```bash
ng new <project-name>
cd <project-name>
```

The Angular CLI's `new` command will set up the latest Angular build in a new project structure.

```bash
ng serve
